libpthread-stubs
------------------------------------------
This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided in libc
or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely on pthread
stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when linked to
libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running single-threaded.
libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on platforms which do not supply
all the necessary pthread stubs.

On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
still obtain correct behavior.

Build requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.0-61
  autoconf2.5-2.63-10
  automake1.11-1.11-10
  binutils-2.19.51-1
  cygport-0.9.9-1
  gawk-3.1.7-1

Build instructions:
  unpack libpthread-stubs-0.2-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./libpthread-stubs-0.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libpthread-stubs-0.2-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libpthread-stubs-0.2-X.tar.bz2
